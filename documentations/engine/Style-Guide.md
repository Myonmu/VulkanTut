# Style Guide

## Naming Conventions

The style follows the tutorial, which differs from C++ default stype:

- Classes and Structs are UpperCamelCase
- Members (fields, functions) are lowerCamelCase (with an exceptional house rule)
- Macros and constant numeric values are ALL_CAPS

House rules:

- get methods generated by macros (especially `CTX_PROPERTY`) always follow `get_someField()` syntax. This helps when you try to search for usages as the IDE doesn't collect them - search for "someField" instead
- sometimes, the before-mentionned "get_" syntax may apply to fields that are not generated by macros. This is reserved for a future refactoring.

*example: `get_logicalDevice()` is generated by `CTX_PROPERTY(LogicalDevice, logicalDevice)`, while `getLogicalDevice()` does the same thing but is explicitly implemented as part of the `SubContext` class.*
